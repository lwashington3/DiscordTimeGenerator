# Discord Timestamp Generator

Created an application to make it easy to generate Discord Timestamps.

## Benefits
- No need to convert between timezones, Discord will do that automatically.
- Better formatting
- Allows users to expand to a full date with taking up space.

## Install
To get the self-contained version (meaning you won't need .NET on your computer) download and unzip the folder. Open the file `install.bat` and it should extract the executable file from the compress file. Open the .exe, and there you go.
(Note, the reason it's in there is because GitHub won't hold files over 100 MB.)
