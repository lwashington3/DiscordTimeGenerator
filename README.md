# Discord Timestamp Generator

Created an application to make it easy to generate Discord Timestamps.

## Self-contained installation
Note, to get the self-contained version (meaning you won't need .NET on your computer) download the /DiscordTime/publish folder and unzip Discord.exe from Discord.exe.zip. The reason it's in there is because GitHub won't hold files over 100 MB.
